## Usage

*Some examples (as if the datetime was `June 20th, 2024 6:30pm`)*:

<ex.TimeAgo />


## How it works

The `TimeAgo` component is rendered as an empty `<time datetme="..." data-relative>` tag that, when inserted into the page, the datetime is rendered by JavaScript.


## Localization

The locale used for the localization of the dates is, in order of priority:

1. The optional `lang` attribute of the component; or
2. The `lang` attribute of the `<body>` tag

Both can be a comma-separated lists of locales (e.g.: `"en-US,en-UK,en`). If none of these attributes exists, or if the locales are not supported by the browser, it fallsback to the default browser language.

*Some examples (as if the datetime was `June 20th, 2024 6:30pm`)*:

<ex.TimeAgo.Locale />


## Component arguments

## `TimeAgo`

<Arguments>
  datetime | str | Required
  lang | str | Optional comma-separated list of locales to use for formatting. If not defined, the attribute <code>lang</code> of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag will be used. If that is also not defined, or none of the locales are supported by the browser, the default browser language is used
  now | str | Optional ISO-formatted date to use as the 'present time'. Useful for testing.
