  A wrapper over the Popover API with anchor positioning.
</Header>

Pop-overs are powerful components with many use cases like edit menus,
custom notifications, content pickers, or help dialogs.

They can also be used for big hideable sidebars, like a shopping cart or action panels.
Pop-overs are **always non-modal**. If you want to create a modal popoverover, a `Dialog`
component is the way to go instead.

<ExampleTabs
  prefix="demo"
  :panels="{
    'Result': 'ui.Popover.DemoResult',
    'HTML': 'ui.Popover.DemoHTML',
    'CSS': 'ui.Popover.DemoCSS',
  }"
/>

A `Popover` starts hidden on page load by having `display:none` set on it (the Popover API does it automatically). To show/hide the popover, you need to add some control `PopButton`s.

When a popover is shown, it has `display:none` removed from it and it is put into the top layer so, unlike just using `position: absolute`, it's guaranteed that it will sit on top of all other page content.


## Anchor positioning

By default, a popover appears centered in the layout view, but this component allows you to  position it relative to an specific element in the page, using the `anchor` and `anchor-to` attributes.

`anchor` is the ID of the element used as a reference, and  `anchor-to` which side of the anchor to use: "top", "bottom", "right", or "left"; with an optional postfix of "start" or "end" ("center" is the default).

<p>
  <img src="/static//img/anchors.png" alt="Anchor positioning"
    width="595" height="324" style="display:block;margin:60px auto;" />
</p>

The positioning is done every time the popover opens, but you can trigger the re-position, for example, on windows resizing, by calling the `jxui-popover/setPosition(popover)` function.


## Styling states

| CSS selector        | Description
| ------------------- | --------------
| `[popover]`         | Every popover has this attribute
| `:popover-open`     | This pseudo-class matches only popovers that are currently being shown
| `::backdrop`        | This pseudo-element is a full-screen element placed directly behind showing popover elements in the top layer, allowing effects to be added to the page content behind the popover(s) if desired. You might for example want to blur out the content behind the popover to help focus the user's attention on it


## Closing modes

A `Popover` can be of two types: "auto" or "manual". This is controlled by the `mode` argument.

| Argument           | Description
| ------------------ | --------------
| `mode="auto"`      | The `Popover` will close automatically when the user clicks outside of it, or when presses the Escape key.
| `mode="manual"`    | The `Popover` will not close automatically. It will only close when the user clicks on a linked `PopButton` with `action="close"` or `action="toggle"`.

If the `mode` argument is not set, it defaults to "auto".


## `PopButton` actions

A `PopButton` can have an `action` argument, which can be set to one of three values: "open", "close", or "toggle". This argument determines what happens to the target `Popover` when the button is clicked.

| Argument          | Description
| ----------------- | --------------
| `action="open"`   | Opens the target `Popover`. If the `Popover` is already open, it has no effect.
| `action="close"`  | Closes the target `Popover`. If the `Popover` is already closed, it has no effect.
| `action="toggle"` | This is the default action. It toggles the target `Pop â€“ opening it if it's closed and closing it if it's open.


## Animating popovers

Popovers are set to `display:none;` when hidden and `display:block;` when shown, as well as being removed from / added to the [top layer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Top_layer). Therefore, for popovers to be animated, the `display` property [needs to be animatable].

[Supporting browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display#browser_compatibility) animate `display` flipping between `none` and another value of `display` so that the animated content is shown for the entire animation duration. So, for example:

- When animating `display` from `none` to `block` (or another visible `display` value), the value will flip to `block` at `0%` of the animation duration so it is visible throughout.
- When animating `display` from `block` (or another visible `display` value) to `none`, the value will flip to `none` at `100%` of the animation duration so it is visible throughout.

<Callout>
When animating using CSS transitions, `transition-behavior:allow-discrete` needs to be set to enable the above behavior. When animating with CSS animations, the above behavior is available by default; an equivalent step is not required.
</Callout>


### Transitioning a popover

When animating popovers with CSS transitions, the following features are required:

- `@starting-style` at-rule

  Provides a set of starting values for properties set on the popover that you want to transition from when it is first shown. This is needed to avoid unexpected behavior. By default, CSS transitions only occur when a property changes from one value to another on a visible element; they are not triggered on an element's first style update, or when the `display` type changes from `none` to another type.

-  `display` property

  Add `display` to the transitions list so that the popover will remain as `display:block` (or another visible `display` value) for the duration of the transition, ensuring the other transitions are visible.

- `overlay` property

  Include `overlay` in the transitions list to ensure the removal of the popover from the top layer is deferred until the transition completes, again ensuring the transition is visible.

- `transition-behavior` property

  Set `transition-behavior:allow-discrete` on the `display` and `overlay` transitions (or on the `transition` shorthand) to enable discrete transitions on these two properties that are not by default animatable.

For example, let's say the styles we want to transition are `opacity` and `transform`: we want the popover to fade in or out while moving down or up.

To achieve this, we set a starting state for these properties on the hidden state of the popover element (selected with the `[popover]` attribute selector) and an end state for the shown state of the popover (selected via the `:popover-open` pseudo-class). We also use the `transition` property to define the properties to animate and the animation's duration as the popover gets shown or hidden:

```css
/*** Transition for the popover itself ***/
[popover]:popover-open {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: scaleX(1);
}
[popover] {
  transition: all 0.2s allow-discrete;
  /* Final state of the exit animation */
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(-3rem);
}
[popover]:popover-open {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
}
/* Needs to be after the previous [popover]:popover-open rule
to take effect, as the specificity is the same */
@starting-style {
  [popover]:popover-open {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(-3rem);
  }
}

/*** Transition for the popover's backdrop ***/
[popover]::backdrop {
  /* Final state of the exit animation */
  background-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 0%);
  transition: all 0.2s allow-discrete;
}
[popover]:popover-open::backdrop {
  background-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 15%);
}
@starting-style {
  [popover]:popover-open::backdrop {
    background-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 0%);
  }
}
```

You can see a working example of this in the demo [at the beginning of the page](#startpage).

<Callout>
Because popovers change from <code>display:none</code> to <code>display:block</code> each time they are shown, the popover transitions from its <code>@starting-style</code> styles to its <code>[popover]:popover-open</code> styles every time the entry transition occurs. When the popover closes, it transitions from its <code>[popover]:popover-open</code> state to the default <code>[popover]</code> state.

<b>So it is possible for the style transition on entry and exit to be different.</b>

## Accessibility notes

### Mouse interaction

- Clicking a `PopButton` will trigger the button action (open, close, or toggle state).

- Clicking outside of a `Popover` will close *all* the `Popover` with `mode="auto"`.


### Keyboard interaction

- Pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> keys on a `PopButton` will trigger
the button action (open, close, or toggle state), and close *all* the `Popover` with `mode="auto"`.

- Pressing the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key will close *all* the `Popover` with `mode="auto"`.
