<Example name="ui.Details" />

The name attribute enables multiple `<Details>` elements to be connected, with only one open at a time. The `<Details>` elements don't even have to be adjacent to one another in the source to be part of the same group.

<Example name="ui.Accordion" />


## Events

The `Details` component doesn't emit or listen to any events, but the native `<details>` element inside do.

In addition to the usual events supported by HTML elements, the `<details>` element supports the `toggle` event,
which is dispatched to the `<details>` element whenever its state changes between open and closed.

The `toggle` event is sent *after* the state is changed, although if the state changes multiple times before the
browser can dispatch the event, the events are coalesced so that only one is sent.

```js
details.addEventListener("toggle", (event) => {
  if (details.open) {
    /* the element was toggled open */
  } else {
    /* the element was toggled closed */
  }
});
```
